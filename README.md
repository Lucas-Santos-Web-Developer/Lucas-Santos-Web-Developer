## Academic Formation :man_student:

I am studying the second period of the software engineering course at the **Estácio de Sá university**.

## How I got to know the world of programming and web development.
When I was 17, I dreamed of being a tony stark (marvel's Iron Man) who created his own gear and trinkets. This led me to several google searches such as:
- "How to create an arc reactor at home?";
- "How to create an armored armor?";
- "How to create your own J.A.R.V.I.S?";

But it was researching J.A.R.V.I.S's artificial intelligence that I discovered the world of programming and, in a research related to the topic, I ended up getting to know the area of web development and changing my mind along the way.

Today I am passionate about this area and I intend to learn as much as possible about it, it will make me better and better than I was yesterday, the day before yesterday or even in 2017 when I wanted to become Tony Stark.
